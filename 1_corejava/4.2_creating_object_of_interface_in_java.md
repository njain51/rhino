#### How to create an object of anonymous class in Java

```java
package com.examples.collection.examples;

interface check {
    public void message();
}
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            check t = new check() {//how????????????????
                public void message() {
                    System.out.println("Method defined in the interface");
                    
                }
            };
            t.message();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            System.out.println("" + ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

- output
```
Method defined in the interface
```

- **Explanation**:

- With that syntax, you create an anonymous class, which is perfectly legal.

- Internally, anonymous classes are compiled to a class of their own, called EnclosingClass$n where the enclosing class' name precedes the $ sign. and n increases for each additional anonymous class. This means that the following class is being created:


```java
class App$1 implements check {
     public void message() {
         System.out.println("Method defined in the interface");
     }
}
```


- Then, the code in main compiles to internally use the newly-defined anonymous class:

```
check t = new Interface$1();
t.message();

```
