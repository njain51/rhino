**default throw/catch mechanism:** 
- Whenever exception situation occurs in a program, java will create object which will catch that exception and describe it. 
- So when that exception occurs, that object containing the exception message is thrown and default catch mechanism of java will catch that object
    and based on message it will print that error message to the program.
- it will be in some technical language so user won't be  able to understand it 
- also it will end the program so it's not robust.

In order to prevent above scenario: 
- we write our own throw/catch mechanism
- message printed is user friendly. 
- program does not end abruptly

**In  total four options are possible:** 
- default throw and default catch 
- default throw and our catch
- our throw and default catch
- our throw and our catch
