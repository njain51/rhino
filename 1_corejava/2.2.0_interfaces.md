# Interface

- Another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces.
- An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods
  with empty bodies. 
- To access the interface methods, the interface must be "**implemented**" (kinda like inherited) by another class with the implements'
  keyword (instead of extends). The body of the interface method is provided by the "implementing" class.

[example interface](https://github.com/njain51/orangutan/tree/main/src/main/java/examples/corejava/example_interface

- a) It cannot be used to create objects (in the example above, it is not possible to create an "Cars" object in the MyMainClass)
- b) Interface methods does not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class.
- c) On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
- d) **Interface methods are by default abstract and public**
- e) Interface attributes are by default public, static and final
- f) An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)
- Interfaces don't have method body but just method header. 
- interfaces would be implemented by inheriting class
- use inherits keyword for it. 
- class can implement any number of interfaces seperated by comma
- class can extend only one parent class. 

```java
// Interface
interface Cars {
  final int cc = 1000; 
  public void carSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void hornSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}
// Maruti "implements" the Cars interface
class Maruti implements Cars {
  public void carSound() {
    // The body of carSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("zoom zoom");
  }
  public void hornSound() {
    // The body of hornSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("peep peep");
  }
 public void get_cc() {
    // The body of hornSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("cc="+cc);
  }

}
class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Maruti myCar = new Maruti();  // Create a Maruti object
    myCar.carSound();
    myCar.hornSound();
    myCar.get_cc();
  }
}
```
```text
Output-
zoom zoom
peep peep
1000
```

##Multiple interfaces

-To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma:

```java
interface FirstInterface {
  public void myMethod(); // interface method
}

interface SecondInterface {
  public void myOtherMethod(); // interface method
}

class DemoClass implements FirstInterface, SecondInterface {
  public void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Some text..");
  }
  public void myOtherMethod() {
    System.out.println("Some other text...");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    DemoClass myObj = new DemoClass();
    myObj.myMethod();
    myObj.myOtherMethod();
  }
}
```
```text
Output-
Some text...
Some other text...
```

**- we cannot instantiate object using Interface name just , it has to be instantiated by implementing class**

- note this code for App.java: 
This also tells one of major use of interfaces in java. 
So we can pass diff objects to interface variable and as long these objects are implementing same interface, we can call Interface method implemented by a respective object. 

- its good practice to design programme by using interface only. 

- Another scenario
```text
When we open Bank account, we look into interrest rates, branches located etc. 
But after we open, we expect some common facilities like deposit, withdraw etc. 
These facilities we can define using interface. 
```
