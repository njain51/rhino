##### Reflection in Java

-  Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.
- The required classes for reflection are provided under java.lang.reflect package.
- Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.
- Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.


##### Reflection can be used to get information about –

- Class The getClass() method is used to get the name of the class to which an object belongs.
- Constructors The getConstructors() method is used to get the public constructors of the class to which an object belongs.
- Methods The getMethods() method is used to get the public methods of the class to which an objects belongs.

- App.java
```java
package com.examples.collection.reflection;

public class App {

    private String s;

   public App(){

       this.s = "Test";
   }

   public void method1(){
       System.out.println("Inside Method 1 and String is " +s );
   }

    public void method2(int n){
        System.out.println("Inside Method 2, number is " + n + "and String is " +s );
    }

    private void method3(){
        System.out.println("Inside Private Method 3, String is " +s);
    }


}


```

- Main.java 
```java
package com.examples.collection.reflection;


import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        App obj = new App();

        //Get class details
        Class cls = obj.getClass();
        System.out.println(cls.getName());   // it will print com.examples.collection.reflection.App

        // get Constructor details
        Constructor cons = cls.getConstructor();
        System.out.println(cons.getName());

        // get public methods
        Method[] method = cls.getMethods();
        for (Method meth : method) {
            System.out.println(meth.getName());
        }
        // creates object of desired method by providing the
            //        // method name and parameter class as arguments to
            //        // the getDeclaredMethod
         Method methodobj1 = cls.getDeclaredMethod("method1");
         Method methodobj2 = cls.getDeclaredMethod("method2", int.class);


         // invokes method at runtime
            methodobj1.invoke(obj);
            methodobj2.invoke(obj,19);

        // creates object of the desired field by providing
        // the name of field as argument to the
        // getDeclaredField method

        Field field = cls.getDeclaredField("s");

        // allows the object to access the field irrespective
        // of the access specifier used with the field
        field.setAccessible(true);

        // takes object and the new value to be assigned
        // to the field as arguments
        //  invokes the method at runtime
         field.set(obj,"JAVA");
         methodobj1.invoke(obj);

        // Creates object of the desired method by providing
        // the name of method as argument to the
        // getDeclaredMethod method
        Method methodobj3 = cls.getDeclaredMethod("method3");

        // allows the object to access the method irrespective
        // of the access specifier used with the method
        methodobj3.setAccessible(true);

        // invokes the method at runtime
        methodobj3.invoke(obj);

    }

}

#### Important observations :

1. We can invoke an method through reflection if we know its name and parameter types. We use below two methods for this purpose getDeclaredMethod() :
   To create an object of method to be invoked. The syntax for this method is

```
Class.getDeclaredMethod(name, parametertype)
name- the name of method whose object is to be created
parametertype - parameter is an array of Class objects

example: Method methodobj2 = cls.getDeclaredMethod("method2", int.class);

```

2. invoke() : To invoke a method of the class at runtime we use following method–

```
Method.invoke(Object, parameter) 
If the method of the class doesn’t accepts any parameter then null is passed as argument.
```

#### Access Private Methods

- Through reflection we can access the private variables and methods of a class with the help of its class object and invoke the method by using the object as discussed above. We use below two methods for this purpose.
- Class.getDeclaredField(FieldName) : Used to get the private field. Returns an object of type Field for specified field name.
- Field.setAccessible(true) : Allows to access the field irrespective of the access modifier used with the field.
  
#### Advantages of Using Reflection:

- Extensibility Features: An application may make use of external, user-defined classes by creating instances of extensibility objects using their fully-qualified names.
- Debugging and testing tools: Debuggers use the property of reflection to examine private members on classes.
 

#### Drawbacks:

- Performance Overhead: Reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.
- Exposure of Internals: Reflective code breaks abstractions and therefore may change behavior with upgrades of the platform.
