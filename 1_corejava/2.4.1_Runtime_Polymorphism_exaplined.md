# Example1


```java

// Parent class
public class Plant {

    public void grow() 
    {
        
        System.out.println("Plant Growing");
    }
}

// Child class
public class Tree extends Plant {

    @Override
    public void grow(){
        System.out.println("Tree Growing");
    }

    public void shedLeaves(){
        System.out.println("Shedding leaves");
    }
}

//   Implementing class: 

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Plant plant = new Plant();
        Tree tree = new Tree();

        Plant plant2 = tree;// plant2 is referring to tree object which is child class of plant..

        tree.grow(); // it will call grow method in Tree class
        plant.grow();  // it will call grow method in Plant class
        plant2.grow(); // it will call grow method in Tree class

        tree.shedLeaves(); //tree object calling Tree class method.
        // plant.shedLeaves()  this will not work since plant object has no access to Tree method.
        //plant2.shedLeaves() wont's work too since plant2 is plant reference so at time of loading the class, it will still not know about Tree methods.

        //- it's the variable reference of the class which tells which method to be called.
        //But its the object reference to which variable is pointing which will decide which method would be executed - the child method implementation or parent method with same name.

        // next we create following:
        Plant plant3; // plant3 should know what methods it can call.

        doGrow(tree); // first thing doGrow is static method called from another static method so no object is needed. 
                     // Second since we are passing tree object so now it will invoke grow method of tree

    }

    public static  void doGrow(Plant plant){
        plant.grow(); //  plant object already contains grow method so we can call grow() method to it.
    }


}

```

```
Output:
Tree Growing
Plant Growing
Tree Growing
Shedding leaves
Tree Growing
```


- if we have child class and parent class( here Plant is Parent class and Tree is child class) Wherever parent class is expected we can pass child
  class.

- it's the variable reference of the class which tells which method to be called.
 
- But it's the object reference to which variable is pointing which will decide which method would be executed - the child method implementation or
  parent method with same name.
 
- Whenever @Override is done then object will always run child method only.

- Plant plant2 = tree; // plant2 is referring to tree object which is child class of plant.. plant2.shedLeaves() wont's work too since plant2 is plant
  reference so at time of loading the class, it will still not know about Tree methods.

```java
class A {
    void display() {
       
    }
}

class B extends A {
    void display() {

        System.out.println("Hi");
    }
}

class C extends A {
    void display() {

        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

class App3 {
    void show(A obj) {  // here we are passing object of parent class which will be used to call display method of impelmenting child class.
        obj.display();
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        A obj1 = new B(); //  Reference of A is referring to object of child B at runtime , runtime polymorphism
        App3 A3 = new App3();  // to avoid redundancy , we use runtime polymorphism ==> to avoid multiple method overloading and we passing child class reference at runtime // we use runtime polynmorphisrm .
        A3.show(obj1);

        // obj1.display();

        A obj2 = new C();  //  Reference of A is referring to object of child C at runtime
        App3 A4 = new App3();
        A4.show(obj2);
        // obj2.display();
    }
}

```

```
Output
Hi
Hello
```
