### How java programs run ? / How Java is platform-independent but JVM is platform dependent

Java programs are written in text as other programs and are converted to binary by javac program
```text
Text *.java ------------javac-----------------> Binary *.class----------JVM(JRE)------>Computer Program
```


- The result of the JAVA compiler is the .class file or the bytecode and not the machine native code (unlike C compiler).
- The bytecode generated is a non-executable code and needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. **This interpreter is the JVM and thus the Bytecode is executed by the JVM.**
- the main point here is that the JVM depends on the operating system â€“ so if you are running Mac OS X you will have a different JVM than if you are running Windows or some other operating system

- We can provide different kinds of JVM for different platforms,different machine architectures and each JVM run  Java binaries in same manner irrespective of hardware.

- In case of C/C++ compiled code is machine native code and is OS dependent hence it cannot be executed on another OS.
- That's why Java is called Platform Independent Language.
