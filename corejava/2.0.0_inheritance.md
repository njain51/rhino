# Inheritance

- use `extends` keyword to inherit class
- with inheritance, child class will by default import all methods of parent class. 
- we can override methods of parent class in child class
- we can introduce new methods in child class. 

- Use @Override whenever overriding method of parent class. This would check if method is properly overridden and not misspelled etc. 

- private methods/variables of parent class will not be accessible in child class. 
- protected methods/variables of parent class will be accessible by child class as well as within same package. 
- **not a good practice to override variables. Just try to override methods only.**
 
- Child classes inherit variables and methods from the parent class. In Java, we use extends keyword to generate child class.

- Syntax-
```java
class child_class extends parent_class
           {
           }
 
class Teacher 
     {
         String designation = "Teacher";
         String collegeName = "IIT";
         void profession()
             {
	       System.out.println("Teaching");
             }
      }
public class PhysicsTeacher extends Teacher
     {
          String mainSubject = "Physics";
          public static void main(String args[])
              {
	        PhysicsTeacher obj = new PhysicsTeacher();
	        System.out.println(obj.collegeName);
	        System.out.println(obj.designation);
	        System.out.println(obj.mainSubject);
	        obj.profession();
              }
     }
```

```text

 Output-
     IIT
     Teacher
     Physics
     Teaching

```
