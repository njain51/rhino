# Abstract Class

- these are those classes for which we cannot create object or cannot instantiate it.
- it will have abstract keyword
- Java Abstract classes are usd to declared common characteristics of subclases
- it can only be used as superclas for other classes that extend abstract clas
- abstract class will have abstract methods. So in this case we dont want parent class to implement the method but only want child class to implement it. 

example: 
src/main/java/collections/main/java/corejava/example_abstract

- Machine.java:  3 abstract methods are defined and 4th method is just defining sequence of abbstract methods to be run. 
- Car.java; Camera.java:  it extends Machine so its child to Machine class, so it can implement abstract methods defined in Machine class
- App.java :  Main class, we are not instantiating Machine class which is Abstract but only Car and Camera which are child classes.
- Machine car2= new Car(); // this is perfectly valid as we can use reference of abstract class.

**Scenario when we create Abstract clas:** 
Lets say we want to create two clases for Coaching institute - Student and Faculty. Both are derived from Person class and we dont want object of person class to be created. 


**Abstract class vs Interface:** 
- Abstract claSS can have any access modifiers for members but interface can have only public members. 
-  In both cases child classs will implement methods of interface or abstract class but in former case when child class extends absract class, it's much stronger implementation as child class will be of parent type. 
- In Abstract class we can have own method implementation too. That means, it can have both abstract and non anstract methods. But in interface by default all methods are abstract methods.
- child can only extend one parent Abstract class but can implement many interfaces. 
- abstract class can have static and non-static members but in interface by default variables are static only( although we don't write static keyword for it)
-  there are no constructor(s) defined in interface but we can have constructor in Abstract classes. 

 
**Abstract Methods:** 

- can only be part of Abstract class. 
- Abstract method declaration must end with semicolon. 
- if a class has any abstract methods whether declared or inherited then entire class will be declared abstract.
