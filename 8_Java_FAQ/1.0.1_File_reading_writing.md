# File class in java

[reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-class-in-java/?ref=gcse)

- For any File related operations This calls can be imported 
- representation of file or directory pathname 
- The File class contains several methods for working with the pathname, deleting and renaming files, creating new directories, listing the contents of a directory, and determining several common attributes of files and directories. 



- First of all, we should create the File class object by passing the filename or directory name to it.
- Instances of the File class are immutable; that is, once created, the abstract pathname represented by a File object will never change.

## How to Create File Object:
```text
File a = new File("/usr/local/bin/geeks");
```

## Reading File path and name

## Reading Content of file

- Java FileWriter and FileReader classes are used to write and read data from text files (they are Character Stream classes)
- It is recommended not to use the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes if you have to read and write any textual information as these are Byte stream classes.

### FileReader:

- FileReader is useful to read data in the form of characters from a ‘text’ file.

- This class inherited from the InputStreamReader Class.
- The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are appropriate. To specify these values yourself, construct an InputStreamReader on a FileInputStream.

- FileReader is meant for reading streams of characters. For reading streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileInputStream.

- **Using FileReader**
- Here file need to explictly closed hence not recommended.

- **Using Files.lines(Path) method**

- **Using FileUtils java from https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html**
