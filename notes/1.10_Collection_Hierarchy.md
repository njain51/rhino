Collection is an Interface. Its part of java.util package. 

Depending on Memory Management and Api's it is further classified as follows:  
Note: Every Interface will have subclasses which will be further classified into 
(a) Abstract Classes (b) Concrete Classes
Concrete Classes - These are classes which internally implements Interfaces or extends any Abstract Class.
An abstract class cannot be directly instantiated using the new keyword. A concrete class can be directly instantiated using the new keyword. An abstract class may or may not contain abstract methods

Collection(I) is further classified to List(I), Queue(I) and SET(I)

Concerte Clases for List(I):  ArrayList; LinkedList, Stalk, Vector etc. 
Concrete Classes for Queue(I): Priority Queue etc
Concrete Classes for Set(I) are: HashSet, LinkedHashSet; Set(I) further have another child Interface called - SortedSet(I) - this have concrete class called TreeSet. 

Another Seperate Interface which is also part of java.util but which is not child of Colleciton(I) is Map(I).
Concrete Class for Map(I): HashMap, LinkedHashMap etc. 
Map(I) has another child Interface : SortedMap(I)
Concrete Calss for SortedMap(I): TreeMap etc. 

Then we have other Interfaces: 
- Iterator(I)
- List Iterator(I)
- Enumeration(I)
- Comparator(I)
- Comparable(I)
