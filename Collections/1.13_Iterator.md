Iterator:

- its an Interface
- Commonly used methods are : public Object Next(); public Boolean hasNext() ; public void remove()
- its implementing class is not fixed. Different interface have their implementing class which use iterator in their own way. 
 example:  
   ArrayList a1 = new ArrayList(); //a1 is onject of ArrrayList class
   if we run iterator on a1 then we will get iterator i which is object of implemeting class of iterator caleld ArrayList. 
   
 - ArrayList class implement List interface which is child interface of Collection(I) and Colection(I) has iterator method with it. 
  So ArrayList class above is overwriting iterator method of Colection(I)
  
     `  public Iterator iterator(){
           System.out.println("test");
           return iterator();
       }`
       
   Above is method iterator with return type Iterator. so its definition is with ArrayList and methos is defined in Colleciton(I)
   So ArrayList is overriding iterator method.
