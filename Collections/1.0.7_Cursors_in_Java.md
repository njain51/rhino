# Cursors available in Java

- If we want to retrieve objects one by one from the Collection, then we should go for Cursors

## There are 3 cursors available in Java:
- Enumerations
- Iterator
- ListIterator

## Enumeration

- to retrieve objects one by one from old Collection Objects(Legacy Colections)
- We can create Enumeration object by using elements() method of vector class

- An object that implements the Enumeration interface generates a series of elements, one at a time. Successive calls to the nextElement method return successive elements of the series.

- Methods are provided to enumerate through the elements of a vector, the keys of a hashtable, and the values in a hashtable. Enumerations are also used to specify the input streams to a SequenceInputStream.

example: 
```java

public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Vector<String> v = new Vector<>();

        v.add("ram");
        v.add("shyam");
        v.add("sami");
        v.add("sapna");

        Enumeration<String> e = v.elements();
        while (e.hasMoreElements()){
            System.out.println(e.nextElement());
        }

    }
}
```

output:
```text
ram
shyam
sami
sapna
```

NOTE: **The functionality of this interface is duplicated by the Iterator interface. In addition, Iterator adds an optional remove operation, and has shorter method names. New implementations should consider using Iterator in preference to Enumeration.**
