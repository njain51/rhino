# Arrays

- its part of Data Structure
- Similar type of Data Stored in contiguous memory location. 
- size is pre-defined or fixed. It cannot be increased at runtime.
- Arrays can hold only homogeneous data elements.

```
example: Student[] s = new Student[1000]; will only hold Student data.

           
   s[0] = new Student();  ==> Valid
   s[1] = new Customer();  ==> will give compile time error.
  
  we can solve this problem by taking 'object type array'.
  
  Object[] a = new Object[10000];
  
  so both are valid now:
  Now, a[0] = new Student();
   a[1] = new Customer(); 
```

But, in this case, we will have to do too much work when we are retriving data. We may also get typecasting issue when converting object data.
     
Further, Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structures and so for every concept we need to write our own logic etc.
Ready-made method support we can't expect with arrays.
