# Arrays

- its part of Data Structure
- Similar type of Data Stored in contiguous memory location. 
- size is pre-defined or fixed. It cannot be increased at runtime.
- Arrays can hold only homogeneous data elements.

```text
example: Student[] s = new Student[1000]; will only hold Student data.

           
   s[0] = new Student();  ==> Valid
   s[1] = new Customer();  ==> will give compile time error.
  
  we can solve this problem by taking 'object type array'.
  
  Object[] a = new Object[10000];
  
  so both are valid now:
  Now, a[0] = new Student();
   a[1] = new Customer(); 
```

- But, in this case, we will have to do too much work when we are retrieving data. We may also get typecasting issue when converting object data. 
- Further, Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structures and so for every concept we need to write our own logic etc.
- Ready-made method support we can't expect with arrays.
