# Reference using Constructor

## Case1:
- Lets say we have Student class with default Constructor and instance method. 

```java
package com.examples.RefDemo.cons;

public class Student {

    // constructor created for Student class
    public Student(){
        System.out.println("Creating object of Student class");
    }


    // Instance method of Student Class
    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("I am a Student");
    }
}

```
- Functional Interface  having one method which is returning Student class object 

```java
package com.examples.RefDemo.cons;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Provider {

    public Student getStudent();
}

```

- Main class implementation using lambda
```java
package com.examples.RefDemo.cons;

public class StudentMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Learning Constructor Reference....");

        Provider provider = () -> {
            return new Student();
        };



        Student student = provider.getStudent();  // since this method is returning Student object
        student.display();  // we can call student class method with this object. 


    }
}


```
Output: 
```text
Learning Constructor Reference....
Creating object of Student class
I am a Student
```

## Case2: we don't want to write whole Lambda implementation but instead we want to just refer constructor of Student class. 

- Writing Main class again using Constructor Reference: 
```java
package com.examples.RefDemo.cons;

public class StudentMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Learning Constructor Reference....");

        Provider provider =  Student::new;

        Student student = provider.getStudent();  // since this method is returning Student object
        student.display();  // we can call student class method with this object.


    }
}

```

**So syntax is :  Classname::new**

Output:
```text
Learning Constructor Reference....
Creating object of Student class
I am a Student
```
