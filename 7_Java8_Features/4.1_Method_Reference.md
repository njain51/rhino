# Method Reference in Java

- These are special type of Lambda expressions

- **It basically helps in method re-usability**

-  that meansm they are often used to create simple lambda expressions by referencing exiting methods


- Each time when you are using lambda expression to just refer functional interface method, you  can replace your lambda expression with method reference. 


## Types of Method Refrences

1- Static Methods
  
2- Instance method of particular objects

3- Constructor


### Very Important: 

-  **When we are providing method reference implementation we should ensure arguments of referring method as well as implementing method of Interface should be same**
- **Return type of method referred can be different than implementing method of Interface**
