# Consumer, Predicate and Supplier:

- These are Functional Interface
- If we need to play with Stream API then we must know about these Functional Interface

## Consumer Functional Interface

- Consumer<T> is an inbuilt functional Interface introduced in Java 8
- it can be used in all contexts where an object needs to be consumed .i.e., taken as input and some other operation to be performed on the object without returning any result. 

- 
```text
/**
Performs this operation on given argument
* @param t the inpput argument

void accept(T t);
**/
```

## Predicate Functional Interface

- This interface is used for Conditional check
- where you think we can use this true/false returning functions in day to day progreamming we should choose Predicate

```text
/** Evalutate this predicates on given argument

* @param t the inpput argument

boolean test(T t);

**/
```

## Supplier Functional Interface

- it can be used in all contexts where there is no input but an output is expected

```text
/** Gets a result

* @return  a result

T get();  // Return type is type generic

**/
```
