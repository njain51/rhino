**getter/setter**

- we need getter setter methods to hide class variables from other classes. 

- And this can also be used to prevent  program crash by passing unwanted values by other programs by specifying condition within getter setter methods.


- while you can have 1 public class in a file you can have as many private classes within same.

- within setter we can use 'this' keyword to refer to instance variable directly. Although it doesn't have 
much significance here but it simply can be used to refer class variable same as object of class do.

for example in following program:
name and age variable are not to be known by other Demo_GS class which is using Frog class. 
so using getter/setter we are completely hiding class variables from other class.
*******************************************
class Frog {
	
	String name;
	int age;
	
	public String getName(){
		return name;
	}
	
	public int getAge(){
		return age;
	}
	
	public void setName(String name){
		this.name = name ;
	}
	
	public void setAge(int age){
		this.age =age;
	}
}
public class Demo_GS {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		Frog f1 = new Frog();
		f1.setAge(21);
		System.out.println(f1.getAge());
		
		f1.setName("Joe");
		System.out.println("Name is "+ f1.getName());
		
	}

}
