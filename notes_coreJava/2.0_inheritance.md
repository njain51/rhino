- with inheritance, child class will by default import all methods of parent class. 
- we can override methods of parent class in child class
- we can introduce new methods in child class. 

- Use @Override whenever overriding method of parent class. This would check if method is properly overridden and not misspelled etc. 

- private methods/variables of parent class will not be accessible in child class. 
- protected methods/variables of parent class will be accessible by child class as well as within same pakcage. 
- not a good practice to override variables. Just try to override methods only.
 
Child classes inherit variables and methods from the parent class. In Java, we use extends keyword to generate child class.
Syntax-

 ` class child_class extends parent_class
           {
           }
Example-
class Teacher 
     {
         String designation = "Teacher";
         String collegeName = "IIT";
         void profession()
             {
	       System.out.println("Teaching");
             }
      }
public class PhysicsTeacher extends Teacher
     {
          String mainSubject = "Physics";
          public static void main(String args[])
              {
	        PhysicsTeacher obj = new PhysicsTeacher();
	        System.out.println(obj.collegeName);
	        System.out.println(obj.designation);
	        System.out.println(obj.mainSubject);
	        obj.profession();
              }
     }`
 Output-
     IIT
     Teacher
     Physics
     Teaching
