public class CalcStringLength {

	static String s = "java";  // s is static variable of type String
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		int t = CalcStringLength.s.length(); //We can access static variable by using class name.
		// CalcStringLength is class name. s is static variable present in class CalcStringLength of type String.
		// length() is a method present in String class that's why we are calling it on String object.
		
		// 
		/* Similarly, there is one class with name System present in java.lang package  and out is static variable of type PrintStream and 
		 * println is method in PrintStream class that's why we are calling it on 'out' object.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * class System {
		 *   static PrintStream out;
		 * }
		 *

		System.out.println(t);
