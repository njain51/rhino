**Abstract Factory Pattern**

Abstract Factory patterns **work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories**


- This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

- In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern

We are going to create a Shape interface and a concrete class implementing it. We create an abstract factory class AbstractFactory as next step. Factory class ShapeFactory is defined, which extends AbstractFactory. A factory creator/generator class FactoryProducer is created.

AbstractFactoryPatternDemo, our demo class uses FactoryProducer to get a AbstractFactory object. It will pass information (CIRCLE / RECTANGLE / SQUARE for Shape) to AbstractFactory to get the type of object it needs


Run: src/main/java/collections/main/java/designpatterns/example_abstractfactory/AbstractFactoryPatternDemo.java

Output:
Inside Rectangle::draw() method.
Inside Square::draw() method.
Inside RoundedRectangle::draw() method
Inside RoundedSquare::draw() method.
