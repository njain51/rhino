## Difference between Array and Collections :

1. Arrays are fixed in size while Collections are growable in nature i.e., based on our requirement we can increase or decrease size.

2. wrt memory arrays are not recommended  but collections do.

3. wrt performance arrays are recommended to use but collections don't.

4. arrays can hold homogeneous data elements while collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous data elements. 

5. No underlying DS exists for arrays so ready made method support not available but in collections it does. 

6. Arrays can hold both primitive and object types( int and Integer) while collections can only hold Objects but not primitive types.
