# Iterator and Iterable:

- Iterable interface is the parent interface of Collection interface.

- Classes which implement Collection interface inherits it’s iterator() method which returns the Iterator object whose methods hasNext() and next() can be used for traversing the data structure.
 
- iterator() is a method coming from Iterable Interface. it returns Iterator<E> object. 
- Iterator<E> is an Interface.  ListIterator<E> is sub-Interface of Iterator<E>

```text
ArrayList<String> list=new ArrayList<String>();
Iterator<String> itr =  list.iterator();
```

- Iterator<E> has hasNext() and next(), remove() methods. So Object implementing this interface ( Any Collection Class Object) can call any of its methods. So above itr is object of Iterator<String> and list is object of ArrayList<String> 
-  So list can call any method of ArrayList so list is calling iterator() methods and its return type is Iterator<String>. Once we have object of Iterator<String> we are calling its methods. 
- it's implementing class is not fixed. it can be list or any other class. 
  
 example:  
   
   ```java
 import java.util.*;
class App8
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        ArrayList<String> list=new ArrayList<String>();
        list.add("Ravi");
        list.add("Vijay");
        list.add("Ravi");
        list.add("Ajay");
        Iterator<String> itr =  list.iterator(); //  [“0”,”1”,”2”,3,4,5,6…..]
       
        System.out.println(itr.toString());   // prints itr object class, java.util.ArrayList$Itr@4c203ea1 , $ Itr represents its inner class

        while(itr.hasNext())
        {
            System.out.println(itr.next());
        }

    }

} 

  ```
   
 - ArrayList class implement List interface which is child interface of Collection(I) and Collection(I) has iterator method with it. 
  So ArrayList class above is overwriting iterator method of Collection(I)
  
       
-  Above is method iterator with return type Iterator( not small i but capital I here).so its definition is with ArrayList and method is defined in
   Colleciton(I) So ArrayList is overriding iterator method.

## Understing Iterator interface methods calling by implementing classes like ArrayList:


```java
// Iterator is separate interface but part of collection framework.

interface Cat {     // Cat Interface refers => Iterator Interface of Collection Framework,  it has got hasNext(), Next(), remove() methods etc. 
    void meeeeow();
}
public class App1 {      // App1 => ArrayList  class which implements List<>

    public Cat nextCat() {    // this is nextCat() method which is returning object of Cat type. 
                             // So object name is same name as parent interface so its  trigger point is anonymous object creation. CAt is now class rather than interface.
                             // nextCat => iterator()

        return new Cat() {       // anonymous class method can be called with Cat object only. 
            public void meeeeow() {   // same as  hasNext(), Next(), remove()
                
                System.out.println("meeeeeeeeeow!!!!");   
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String Args[])

    {
      //  Cat obj1= new Cat();
        App1 obj= new App1();   // obj is object of App1 which is can be assumed same as ArrayList
        Cat c= obj.nextCat();   // obj is calling method of class App1 which is nextCat and it returns object of Cat class. so this can call method of Cat class( which is anonymous class) 
                                // same happens in case of ArrayList Object calling iterator() method which returns Iterator object and it can call methods of Iterator class which are hasNext() etc. 
        c.meeeeow();

    }
}
```
```
Output:
meeeeeeeeeow!!!!
```
