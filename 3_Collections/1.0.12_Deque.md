# Deque interface

- Deque stands for a double-ended queue which enables us to perform the operations at both the ends of the queue
- In Deque, we can remove and add the elements from both the sides which is done internally. 
- Deque interface extends the Queue interface. 
- Deque can be instantiated as: Deque<data-type> d = new ArrayDeque<data-type>();

here:Deque=> Parent interface ; ArrayDeque => child class which implements DeQue

## 2.1) ArrayDeque-

- ArrayDeque class implements the Deque interface. 
- It facilitates us to use the Deque. 
- Unlike queue, we can add or delete the elements from both the ends. ArrayDeque is faster than ArrayList and Stack and has no capacity restrictions.

```java
import java.util.*;  
public class Test
    {  
          public static void main(String[] args)
            {  
               Deque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<String>();  
               deque.add("Fiat");  
               deque.add("Ford");  
               deque.add("Maruti");  
               Iterator<String> iterate = deque.iterator();
               while(iterate.hasNext()) {
                    System.out.print(iterate.next());
                    System.out.print(", ");
              }      
          }  
}  
```

```
Fiat, Ford, Maruti, 
```
